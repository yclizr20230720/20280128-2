# FAB IT Training Program

## Welcome

Welcome to the FAB IT Training Program! This comprehensive 4-week program will transform you from an IT engineer with no semiconductor background into a capable business analyst and system architect for FAB operations.

## Program Overview

**Duration**: 4 weeks (80 hours)  
**Format**: Instructor-led with hands-on exercises  
**Target Audience**: IT engineers new to semiconductor manufacturing  
**Prerequisites**: Basic IT knowledge, willingness to learn

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this program, you will be able to:
- Communicate effectively with FAB stakeholders using proper terminology
- Analyze user requirements systematically using proven BA methodologies
- Design IT system architectures appropriate for FAB environments
- Create implementation plans and project management plans
- Deliver professional system analysis documents

## Program Structure

**Topics**:
- Semiconductor manufacturing fundamentals
- Key FAB processes (Lithography, Etch, Deposition, CMP, Diffusion, Wet)
- Equipment and automation (SECS/GEM, EAP, AMHS)
- FAB stakeholders and IT systems landscape

**Deliverable**: FAB Process Analysis Document

### Week 2: Business Analysis Methodology
**Focus**: Learn systematic requirement elicitation and documentation

**Topics**:
- Business analysis frameworks (BABOK, Agile BA)
- Requirement elicitation techniques (interviews, workshops, observation)
- Requirement documentation (user stories, use cases, EARS format)
- Business process modeling (BPMN, swimlanes)
- FAB-specific BA considerations

**Deliverable**: Requirements Specification Document

### Week 3: System Analysis & IT Architecture
**Focus**: Design IT system architectures for FAB environments

**Topics**:

- IT architecture patterns (layered, microservices, event-driven)
- Design patterns (creational, structural, behavioral)
- FAB IT system integration (MES, EAP, SPC, FDC)
- Technology stack selection
- Information flow modeling

**Deliverable**: System Design Specification Document

### Week 4: Implementation Planning & Project Management
**Focus**: Plan and manage FAB IT project implementation

**Topics**:
